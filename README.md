# Chatbot-V1

<h4> I gained access to the OpenAI beta and created a rudimentary chatbot capable of basic communication skills. I conducted several tests using the same prompt throughout the experiment. Changing only the characteristics of the AI and the temp, we can see changes in vernacular and sentence structure. 
  
# <h4> The temp setting is not a creativity setting but a deterministic setting. At the lowest temp, we can see that the responses are more clear cut and definitive while the highest temp setting gives more open ended responses. The characteristic changes offer distinct personality changes observable through adjectives and grammar.
